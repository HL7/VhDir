1. use json with python models
2. add in must support for
  all existing elements and add in element with only must supports 
    excluding the root,  extension/ modifierextension roots, id and elements inherited from Resource and domainresource and extension descendent.
    
generated white lists using snapshot

create blacklist

['id','meta','implicitRules','language','text']



li = [0, 1, 2, 3]

running = True
while running:
    for idx, elem in enumerate(li):
        thiselem = elem
        nextelem = li[(idx + 1) % len(li)]


3 compare snapshot to root element ids to make a list to add to diff

make sure the python model is valid and up to date for R4  - can't do primitives extesnsions  check if there are any.

# This is an IG Publisher issue for R4 IGs that have concept maps
The modifier extension http://hl7.org/fhir/1.0/StructureDefinition/extension-ConceptMap.element.target.equivalence from FHIR version 1.0 is not allowed to be used at this point (allowed = e:ConceptMap.element.target; this element is [[BackboneElement, ConceptMap.group.element.target]; this is a warning since contexts may be renamed between FHIR versions)

# This is an older implementation guide with low terminology requirements, and some provided for example usage - derived implementation guides are expected to leverage their own jurisdictional terminology.
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# The usage restriction extension is intended to be permitted to attach to any element in a resource by design
Review the extension type for usage-restriction: extensions should not have a context of Element unless it's really intended that they can be used anywhere

# This profile is used contained in other resource types and there are several of these in the IG
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/vhdir/StructureDefinition/vhdir-restriction'): The Implementation Guide contains no explicitly linked examples for this profile

# Example code systems included in examples are not in the IG (derived IGs should define their own)

# There are several core code systems that are defined as draft in THO/FHIR R4

# The restriction extension is an element level profile that isn't specifically sliced anywhere.
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/vhdir/StructureDefinition/vhdir-healthcareservice|1.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/vhdir/StructureDefinition/vhdir-location|1.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# This is an older IG that was using these extensions long before they were deprecated (and the functionality is still supported)
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/regex|5.2.0 is deprecated with the note This was deprecated in favor of using a constraint on the element using FHIRPath, since constraints allow for the provision of a human readable message associated with the regex

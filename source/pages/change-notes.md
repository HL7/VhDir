The Validated Healthcare Directory Implementation guide was developed under the [ONC Healthcare Directory Initiative (HcDir)] (https://oncprojectracking.healthit.gov/wiki/display/TechLabSC/Healthcare+Directory). HcDir was a US initiative sponsored by the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) and Federal Health Architecture (FHA) which aimed to create FHIR profiles for access to a national validated dataset of healthcare directory data. This implementation guide was was initially developed under FHIR Release 3 (STU) and ported into FHIR Release 4 (STU).

Additionaly, this project extends Provider Directory resources created under [The Argonaut Project](http://argonautwiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Main_Page).

An extension to describe accessibility options offered by a practitioner or at a location. 

Accessibility refers to the design of services and environments to support people with disabilities, hardships, or other factors that might limit their access to health care. 
For example, a location may provide signage, lifts, ramps, handrails, etc. 
A practitioner may be culturally competent.

The accessibility extension consists of a required type (CodeableConcept) and optional description (string) to provide additional context about the selected type.

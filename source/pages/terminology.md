This page lists all the ValueSets, CodeSystems, and ConceptMaps defined as part of the Validated Healthcare Directory implementation Guide. For more information on using codes in resources, see the [guidance section](guidance.html#using-codes-in-vhdir-profiles) as well as in the [FHIR specification](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/terminologies.html).

All code systems and value sets in the guide are proposed and undergoing review and harmonization.

#### Value Sets

#### Code Systems

See the [FHIR terminology section](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/terminologies-systems.html) for a complete discussion on code systems and a list of codes system names used in FHIR. The following additional names (URIs) have been identified for this implementation guide,   If a URI is listed here, it **SHALL** be used in the Validated Healthcare Directory profiles in preference to any other code system name.

**Code systems published in this IG** - Includes Validated Healthcare Directory defined code systems and externally defined code systems

This profile sets minimum expectations for searching for and fetching information associated with a health insurance product/plan. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets **SHALL** be present in the InsurancePlan resource when using this profile.

**Background & Scope**

A product is a discrete package of health insurance coverage benefits that are offered under a particular network type. A given payer's products typically differ by network type and/or covered benefits. A plan pairs a product's covered benefits with the particular cost sharing structure offered to a consumer. A given product may comprise multiple plans (i.e. each plan offers different cost sharing requirements for the same set of covered benefits). 

InsurancePlan describes a health insurance offering comprised of a list of covered benefits (i.e. the product), costs associated with those benefits (i.e. the plan), and additional information about the offering, such as who it is owned and administered by, a coverage area, contact information, etc.

This profile modifies the base InsurancePlan resource in the following manner:

*  Constrains the cardinality of `InsurancePlan.status` (1..1), `InsurancePlan.ownedBy` (1..1), `InsurancePlan.administeredBy` (1..1), `InsurancePlan.contact.name.family` (1..1), `InsurancePlan.contact.name.given` (1..*), `InsurancePlan.contact.telecom.system` (1..1), and `InsurancePlan.contact.telecom.value` (1..1)

*  All references SHALL conform to the appropriate Validated Healthcare Directory Implementation Guide profile

*  Adds extensions:

1.  [Identifier status](StructureDefinition-identifier-status.html) (1..1) - indicates the status of a product or plan's identifier
1.  [Via intermediary](StructureDefinition-contactpoint-viaintermediary.html) (0..1) - a reference to an alternative point of contact for this InsurancePlan
1.  [Available time](StructureDefinition-contactpoint-availabletime.html) (0..*) - indicates when the point of contact for an InsurancePlan is available
1.  [Restriction](StructureDefinition-usage-restriction.html) (0..*) - indicates whether disclosure of any data associated with a service is restricted

*  Adds new value sets/updates value set bindings:

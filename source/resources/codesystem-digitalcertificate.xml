	<description value="Public key infrastructure (PKI) refers to the architecture, organizations, techniques, practices, and procedures that collectively support the implementation and operation of a certificate-based public key cryptographic system. A certificate is a set of data that uniquely identifies a key pair and an owner that is authorized to use the key pair. The certificate contains the owner’s public key and other information, and is digitally signed by a Certification Authority (i.e., a trusted party), thereby binding the public key to the owner. This code system includes terms describing various aspects of a certificate-based public key cryptographic system, such as applicable standards, types of certificates, uses of certificates, and associated trust frameworks."/>
